title: CovidCareMap â€“ Open geospatial work to support health systems' capacity to effectively care for rapidly growing COVID19 patient needs
heading: Mapping US health system capacity needs to care for COVID-19 patients
intro: We are a volunteer open-source geospatial effort to map beds, ventilators, supplies, staff, and other resources needed to care for COVID-19 patients. If you collect or use such data, we can help you aggregate, analyze, or visualize it to better inform surge capacity planning and resourcing decisions.

  <p>Our healthcare system is at risk of being overwhelmed. How quickly and how many people are falling ill to COVID-19 at one time may exceed our ability to effectively care for everyone, especially at the ICU level.</p><p>We must #FlattenTheCurve to give our healthcare system more time to prepare for this surge of patients. Preparation means enough space, staff, supplies, and systems at the right places and times to meet patient needs. Through our mapping and analytics, we provide situational awareness and foresight for health systems, policymakers, emergency managers, suppliers, and the public to plan and coordinate preparations between facilities, counties, states, or nationwide.</p>
