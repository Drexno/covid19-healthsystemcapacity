In normal operation hospitals have a bed occupancy rate that describes how many beds are occupied by non-COVID-19 patients and therefore not available to handle the surge of patients as a result of the pandemic. Furthermore, not all hospital beds are the same: we also need to know the counts and occupancy rates of ICU (Intensive Care Unit) beds, which are required to service patients in critical condition.\n",
