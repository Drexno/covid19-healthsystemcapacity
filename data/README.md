The 'published' directory contains datasets published by COVID Care Map. These are data that
have been aggregated from various sources, analyzed, processed, inspected for validity and
written to common data formats for easy consumption.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: This data may be updated. If you want to pull directly from links where the data does not change, see the note in the main README about [Using Tags](../README.md#using-tags)

### CovidCareMap US Healthcare System Capacity data

This data aggregates information about the healthcare system capacity. It sources data from
the [Healthcare Cost Report Information System (HCRIS)](#healthcare-cost-report-information-system-hcris-data) and
an open hospital facilities dataset by [Definitive Healthcare](#definitive-health-dh-data).

##### CovidCareMap Capacity Data Dictionary

These fields are across all facility and regional datasets:

- **Name**: Name of the facility, same as Definitive Healthcare data.

- **Hospital Type**: Hospital Type from Definititve Healthcare data. See [Hospital Types](#hospital-type)

- **Address**, **Address_2**, **City**, **State**, **Zipcode**, **County**, **Latitude**, **Longitude**: Location information from the Definitive Healthcare data.

- **Staffed All Beds** - Number of hospital beds of all types typically set up and staffed for inpatient care as reported/estimated in selected facility or area

- **Staffed ICU Beds** - Number of ICU beds typically set up and staffed for intensive inpatient care as reported/estimated in selected facility or area

- **Licensed All Beds** - Number of hospital beds of all types licensed for potential use in selected facility or area

- **All Bed Occupancy Rate** - % of hospital beds of all types typically occupied by patients in selected facility or area

- **ICU Bed Occupancy Rate** - % of ICU beds typically occupied by patients in selected facility or area

- **CCM_ID** - Unique identifier for the facility. Matches the Definitive Healtchare ID until new facilities are added or other datasets are brought in.

- **DH-OBJECTID** - The `OBJECTID` in the Definitive Healthcare dataset for this facility.

- **HCRIS-Provider Number** - The `Provider Number` from the HCRIS reports (also matches the `PROVIDER_NUMBER` field
in the facility information).

**Source information**: In the facility dataset there is also a set of columns suffixed with '- SOURCE', which describes the source of the value for the corresponding column. The values are prefixed with 'HCRIS', in which case the number comes from HCRIS data, or 'DH', in which it's Definitive Health data. It also has the column name from that dataset so you can trace everything back to the source datasets. The HCRIS columns are created from the data processing steps, which are traceable back to the origin HCRIS file data value through the processing notebook workflow. The DH data columns match directly to the DH external dataset.

**Per Capita Information**: There are additional per-capita fields in the regional datasets:

- **Population** - Population of this region, sourced by the US Census Bureau 2018 county population estimates.

- **Population (20+)** - Population of people aged 20 years or older.

- **Population (65+)** - Population of people aged 65 years or older.

- **Staffed All Beds [Per 1000 People]**, **Staffed All Beds [Per 1000 Adults (20+)]**, **Staffed All Beds [Per 1000 Elderly (65+)]**, etc. - The `Staffed All Beds`, `Staffed ICU Beds`, and `Licensed All Beds` fields per capita of the population described.

**Ventilator Information**: There is additional information about [estimated mechanical ventilators](#ventilator-data) for state-level data which is from a 2010 study that uses survey data of hospitals conducted in 2009 and US Census population estimates from 2008:

- **Estimated No. Full-Featured Mechanical Ventilators**
- **Estimated No. Full-Featured Mechanical Ventilators per 100,000 Population**
- **Estimated No. Pediatrics-Capable Full-Feature Mechanical Ventilators**
- **Estimated No. Full-Feature Mechanical Ventilators, Pediatrics Capable per 100,000 Population <14**

## External Datasets

External datasets used in the project will be documented here. This includes data committed to
the repository in the `data/external` folder, data downloaded by the
[Download_Data.ipynb](../notebooks/processing/Download_Data.ipynb) notebook, and data
dynamically fetched from updating endpoints, normally exposed through the
`covidcaremap` python package.

### Downloading Data

Note that some data will be committed to
the repository, while others are too big and need to be downloaded by running
the [Download_Data.ipynb](../notebooks/processing/Download_Data.ipynb) notebook.
You must download all the project data to ensure all notebooks run.

#### Definitive Health (DH) Data

Data generated by Definitive Health, who is [opening up their data](https://blog.definitivehc.com/news/definitive-healthcare-esri-geomapping-covid19) for COVID-19 relief (thank you!!!). Definitive Health acquired Billian's HealthDATA in 2016; Billian's is the database referenced in the paper [Assessing the capacity of the healthcare system to use additional mechanical ventilators during a large-scale public health emergency](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4636910/) which we are hoping to use to model capacity under different capacity levels (Conventional, Contingency, Crisis).

#### Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD)

From https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/hospitals.

> This feature class/shapefile contains locations of Hospitals for 50 US states, Washington D.C., US territories of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, and Virgin Islands. The dataset only includes hospital facilities based on data acquired from various state departments or federal sources which has been referenced in the SOURCE field. Hospital facilities which do not occur in these sources will be not present in the database. The source data was available in a variety of formats (pdfs, tables, webpages, etc.) which was cleaned and geocoded and then converted into a spatial database. The database does not contain nursing homes or health centers. Hospitals have been categorized into children, chronic disease, critical access, general acute care, long term care, military, psychiatric, rehabilitation, special, and women based on the range of the available values from the various sources after removing similarities. In this update the TRAUMA field was populated for 172 additional hospitals and helipad presence were verified for all hospitals.

#### CovidCareMap.org US Healthcare System Capacity - Manual Override

This is a file that allows CovidCareMap.org members to manually override facility information. It has the same layout as the CovidCareMap.org US Healthcare Sysmtem Capacity facility data, with two new columns - `Manual Override Reason` and `Manual Override New Data Source`. These columns describe the reason for manuall overriding, and the source where the new data is coming from, respectively.

#### Zip Code Convex hulls

Generated by Simon Kassel. TODO: Describe source, generate with notebook.

##### FILES

- **us_zip_codes-convex_hulls.geojson**: The zip code geojson file for the whole US was prohibitively large so we reduced the size by simplifying the polygons into their [convex hulls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull). This dramatically reduced the file size while keeping enough spatial information for the simple task of validating basic location.
